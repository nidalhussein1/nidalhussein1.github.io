### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it taught me how to add equations
    such as addition and subtraction into code. The lab was a tool of which
    you enter two dates and it calculates the difference between the two.
    It's a helpful tool if you have two dates with long distances between.
    
* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because it further taught me how to interpert
    equations into code. The first part was essentially a tool that converted
    Ml to tsp, tbsp, ounces, and cups. At the end, you were able to enter in
    any value of Ml and it would return the number of Ml in the other types of
    measurments which I thought was pretty cool.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because I liked the concept of the assignment.
    I liked how you can input in any street name, date, and time, and you would
    be told if parking was allowed or not. It also taught me the difference
    between "and" and "or" which was important because "or" means one of the
    options and "and" could mean all.
